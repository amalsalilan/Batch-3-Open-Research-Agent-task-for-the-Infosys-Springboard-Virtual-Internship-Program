## 🧠 About the Project
This project implements an AI-powered research assistant using LangChain and LangGraph.  
It focuses on building a structured workflow that:
- Understands user queries  
- Determines whether clarification is needed  
- Asks follow-up questions when required  
- Generates a clean and detailed research brief  

The goal is to create a modular, scalable system that can later be extended with deeper research capabilities, tools, and report generation modules.
